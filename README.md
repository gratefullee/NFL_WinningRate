# Factors Affecting NFL Teams' Winning Rates

![Football](/img/NFLball.jpg)

When I was at college in Texas, I went to see so many football games. At first I really didn't understand why Texans LOVE football. But after a couple years, I found myself enjoying football games with them. I believe it is more than just a game for a lot of people. We go to see their friends or family during the Superobowl. Football is another Thanksgiving or Christmas. I am not an expert on football yet, but it is always one of my interests.

Football is another industry by itself. People would like to pay up to $25,000 just for a seat. And NFL teams would like to pay enormous money every year to recruit the best football player. Above all things, what they care about is who is going to win the trophy. In this project, I would like to answer what NFL teams can do to increase their winning rates.
